## SOLUTION
Ensuring easy access to a healthy lifestyle is essential for everyone. Ideally, individuals, regardless of disability, should effortlessly engage with their physical conditions and receive personalized exercise recommendations. Effectively managing and recording exercise plans should also be a seamless process.


However, the current landscape of exercise services primarily caters to those without disabilities. This creates a challenge for users with disabilities to discover suitable exercises that accommodate their unique needs. The struggle lies in selecting exercises mindful of their physical limitations and the lack of accessible guidance. Consequently, these hurdles hinder access to exercise and pose difficulties in adopting a healthy lifestyle.


In response, our service aims to enhance health accessibility by providing personalized exercise recommendations based on users' physical characteristics and disability types. Furthermore, the exercise history calendar empowers users to efficiently manage and enhance their exercise plans. Ultimately, this service strives to enable individuals with disabilities to embrace and enjoy healthier lives. 💚💛
